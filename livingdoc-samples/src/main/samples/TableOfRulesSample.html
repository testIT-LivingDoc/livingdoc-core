	<h2>Testing a Table of Rules on a System</h2>

	In this example we're planning to write a calculator executable
	specification. You can find some basic rules in the first executable
	specifications page. We will use the Rule For formalism to define the
	business rules of the basic calculator.

	<div>
		<p>We need to specify the package in which our calculator fixture
			is coded. Once the execution is started, LivingDoc searches the
			fixtures name in the package specified in the import tables.</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>import</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>info.novatec.testit.livingdoc.samples.application.calculator</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>
			In a <b>Rule For formalism</b>, the first row specifies the name of
			the interpreter and the name of the fixture. The second row specifies
			the input parameter names and tests we want to execute. The remaining
			rows indicate values for each input parameter and the expected result
			from the specified tests. In the last row, you can see how expected
			validation errors are specified.
		</p>

		<p>You are now ready to execute the tests.</p>

		<p>
			In last row, we specify that the product of 7 and 0 should be 5
			(column
			<code>product?</code>
			). The cell is now colored in red and we see that there is an error
			since the product of 7 and 0 is 0, not 5. All the other cells are
			colored in green since the expected values match the returned values.
		</p>
