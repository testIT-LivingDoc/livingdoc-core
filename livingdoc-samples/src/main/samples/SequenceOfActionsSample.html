	<h2>Testing a sequence of actions on a System</h2>

	Let's walk through a simple example of a test using a flow style
	interpreter.

	<div>
		<p>First, we need to import the package containing the fixture
			code for our banking application.</p>

		<p>We need to specify the package in which our banking fixture is
			coded. Once the execution is started, LivingDoc searches the fixtures
			name in the package specified in the import tables.</p>
		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>import</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>info.novatec.testit.livingdoc.samples.application.bank</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>
			We want to execute a sequence of actions on the <b>bank</b> fixture.
			We'll use the
			<code>DoWithInterpreter</code>
			for that.
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>do with</td>
				<td>bank</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			Our first business rule says that a new account should have a balance
			of 0.00 dollars. <br /> We will verify this rule with two actions.
			The first one opens and account and the second one checks its
			balance. The <b>check</b> keyword - in the first cell of the second
			row - indicates that we want to check the result of the action
			against the value specified in the last cell.
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>open checking account</td>
				<td>12345</td>
				<td>under the name of</td>
				<td>Spongebob</td>
				<td>&nbsp;</td>
				<td>Squarepants</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>check</td>
				<td>that balance of account</td>
				<td>12345</td>
				<td>is</td>
				<td colspan="2">$0</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>Savings account should follow the same rule. Let's verify that.
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>open savings account</td>
				<td>54321</td>
				<td>under the name of</td>
				<td>Patrick</td>
				<td>&nbsp;</td>
				<td>Star</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>check</td>
				<td>that balance of account</td>
				<td>54321</td>
				<td>is</td>
				<td colspan="2">$0</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			Our next rule says that the bank should not take any fee when we
			deposit money in our account. <br /> So if we deposit 100 dollars in
			one of the newly created accounts, we expect the balance to be
			exactly 100 dollars:
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>deposit</td>
				<td>$100</td>
				<td>in account</td>
				<td colspan="2">12345</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>check</td>
				<td>that balance of account</td>
				<td>12345</td>
				<td>is</td>
				<td>$100</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>The following rule says that a customer should be able to
			withdraw funds if the balance of his account is sufficient.</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>withdraw</td>
				<td>$50</td>
				<td>from account</td>
				<td colspan="2">12345</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>check</td>
				<td>that balance of account</td>
				<td>12345</td>
				<td>is</td>
				<td>$50</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			Nevertheless, checking accounts cannot go overdrawn. If we attempt to
			withdraw too much money, the bank should reject our request. <br />
			Let's try that:
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>reject</td>
				<td>withdraw</td>
				<td>$75</td>
				<td>from account</td>
				<td>12345</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>check</td>
				<td>that balance of account</td>
				<td>12345</td>
				<td>is</td>
				<td>$50</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>Once an account is frozen, we can deposit money in it, but not
			longer withdraw any money from it.</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>freeze account</td>
				<td colspan="4">12345</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>deposit</td>
				<td>$75</td>
				<td>in account</td>
				<td colspan="2">12345</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>withdraw</td>
				<td>$25</td>
				<td>from account</td>
				<td colspan="2">12345</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>check</td>
				<td>that balance of account</td>
				<td>12345</td>
				<td>is</td>
				<td>$125</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

	</div>
