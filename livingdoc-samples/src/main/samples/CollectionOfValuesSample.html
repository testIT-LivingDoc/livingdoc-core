	<h2>Testing collections of values returned by the System</h2>

	LivingDoc offers different kinds of collection interpreters. This
	example shows the use of interpreters of type collection.

	<div>
		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>Import</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>info.novatec.testit.livingdoc.samples.application.phonebook</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>First lets create a collection</h3>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>do with</td>
				<td colspan="5">phone book</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="19%">insert</td>
				<td width="19%">Paul</td>
				<td>&nbsp;</td>
				<td width="19%">Tobin</td>
				<td width="19%">with number</td>
				<td width="19%">(123) 456-7890</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="19%">insert</td>
				<td width="19%">Henry</td>
				<td>&nbsp;</td>
				<td width="19%">Cinq</td>
				<td width="19%">with number</td>
				<td width="19%">(123) 321-7666</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="19%">insert</td>
				<td width="19%">Steve</td>
				<td>&nbsp;</td>
				<td width="19%">Job</td>
				<td width="19%">with number</td>
				<td width="19%">(123) 989-4455</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			This will create a <b>phone book</b> with three entries.
		</p>

		<p>Before moving on with the example, lets clarify what is
			happening in the above table. In this example, the columns with
			values "insert", a whitespace and "with number" are combined by the
			interpreter to know which function to execute. The other columns are
			the values used by the function being executed. So in the case of the
			second table row, LivingDoc would execute a function called
			"insertWithNumber" and give it the parameters "Paul", "Tobin" and
			"(123) 456-7890".</p>

		<p>It is important to note that, in this case, the empty column is
			important for the correct creation of the collection. If the empty
			column was removed, the values that is intended to be used as a value
			(the last name in the example above) would be instead considered as
			part of the function name. The column removal would also offset the
			next columns so that the function being called would be
			"insertTobin(123)456-7890" and its values would be "Paul" and "with
			number".</p>
	</div>

		<h3>Using interpreter of type list</h3>

		<p>
			A <b>list of</b> interpreter retrieves all entries of the specified
			object and makes sure that the retrieved list are in the same order
			as the one specified in the table.
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>list of</td>
				<td>phone book entries</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>first name</td>
				<td>last name</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Paul</td>
				<td>Tobin</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Steve</td>
				<td>Job</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Henry</td>
				<td>Cinq</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>Using interpreter of type subset</h3>

		<p>
			In a <b>set of</b> interpreter, we try to match all the items in the
			rows with those in the SUT collection. The items can be in a
			different order in the test specification and in the SUT collection.
		</p>

		<p>
			Missing rows are rows that are in the test specification but not
			found in the SUT collection. <br /> Surplus rows are rows that are
			found in the SUT collection but not expected in the test
			specification.
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>subset of</td>
				<td>phone book entries</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>first name</td>
				<td>last name</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Joe</td>
				<td>Tagliani</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Henry</td>
				<td>Cinq</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Steve</td>
				<td>Job</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>

	<div>

		<h3>Using interpreter of type superset</h3>

		<p>
			In a <b>superset of</b> interpreter, we assume that all the rows
			returned by the SUT must be present in the test specification. Some
			rows in the test might not be returned by the SUT.
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>superset of</td>
				<td>phone book entries</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>first name</td>
				<td>last name</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Joe</td>
				<td>Tagliani</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Henry</td>
				<td>Cinq</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Steve</td>
				<td>Job</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
