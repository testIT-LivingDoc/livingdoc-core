h2. OGNL Expectations

You can use graph navigation and expression resolution (aka OGNL) inside cells that makes a the check against the SUT.
{livingdoc-import:info.novatec.testit.livingdoc.fixture.ognl}

h3. Boolean expression using the wildcard '?'

You can code a *boolean expression* expectation by using the '?' placeholder in the expected expression. '?' refer to the actual value returned by the query:
|| rule for || Ognl Expectation Fixture ||
| expected | actual | state? |
| ? > 1 | 2 | right |
| ? > 1 | 1 | wrong |
| is leap year( ? ) | 2004 | right |
| is leap year( ? ) | 2006 | wrong |
| ? < 2 or 4 < ? | 1 | right |
| ? < 2 or 4 < ? | 3 | wrong |
| ? < 2 or 4 < ? | 5 | right |
| 2 < ? and ? < 4 | 1 | wrong |
| 2 < ? and ? < 4 | 3 | right |
| 2 < ? and ? < 4 | 5 | wrong |

h3. Boolean expression with String

When a *boolean expression contains a string*, you must enclose it in double quotes:
|| rule for || Ognl Expectation Fixture ||
| expected | actual | state? |
| ? > "a" | a | wrong |
| ? > "a" | b | right |

h3. Only boolean expression can be process

If a placeholder is used and the *return value* from the expression *is not a boolean*, an error occur:
|| rule for || Ognl Expectation Fixture ||
| expected | actual | state? |
| sum(1,?) | 2 | error |

h3. Complex expressions

You can code *more complex expressions* as expected values by starting the expression with an equal sign:
|| rule for || Ognl Expectation Fixture ||
| expected | actual | state? |
| = sum(1,2) | 3 | right |
| = sum(1,2) | 4 | wrong |
| = uppercase("ognl") | OGNL | right |
| = is leap year(2004) | true | right |
| = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 | 10 | right |

h3. Type conversion

If the actual object returned by the query is a *Java Float*, and the expected expression contains some real constants, ognl convert them to Java Double. Force the specific real type to be use by using the float or double suffix (f,F,d,D):
|| rule for || Ognl Expectation Fixture ||
| expected | actual | state? |
| =1.1 | 1.1f | wrong |
| =1.1f | 1.1f | right |
| =1.1 | 1.1d | right |

h3. Complex Boolean expression with wildcard '?'

If coding an *equal expression with placeholders*, it is taken as a boolean expression:
|| rule for || Ognl Expectation Fixture ||
| expected | actual | state? |
| = ? > 1 | 2 | right |

h3. Complex String Boolean expression with wildcard '?'

If expecting *a string that start with an equal sign*, enclose it in double quotes. Also, if I want to use a question mark in the string, I have to enclose it in double quotes:
{livingdoc-info}
TODO we must review this test
|| rule for || Ognl Expectation Fixture ||
| expected | actual | state? |
| "=string" | =string | right |
| "string with a ?" | string with a ? | right |
{livingdoc-info}
