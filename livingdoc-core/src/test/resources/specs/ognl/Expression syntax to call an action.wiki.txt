h2. Expression syntax to call an action

{livingdoc-import:cinfo.novatec.testit.livingdoc.fixture.ognl}

This is the classic way to use an expression to call an action
|| Rule for || Ognl syntax ||
| Check | Result? |
| give year(2006) | 2006 |
| name of month(1) | January |
| year second month() | February |
I want to be able to access an element in a collection using an array syntax:
|| rule for || Ognl syntax ||
| Check | Result? |
| month\[1\] | January |
| month\[7\] | July |
| month\[12\] | December |
| month\[13\] | error |
We can accept blank spaces between the method call, field or property name, and the index braquets:
|| rule for || Ognl syntax ||
| Check | Result? |
| month\[1\] | January |
| month \[1\] | January |
| month \[ 1\] | January |
| month\[ 1 \] | January |
| month \[ 1 \] | January |

h3. Composition of expressions

When the expression is not recognized as a method, a field or a property (getter, setter),
it fall back and evaluated as an OGNL expression:
|| rule for || Ognl syntax ||
| Check | Result? | is using ognl? |
| newYear() | ActionExampleResolution$Year | false|
| newYear().firstMonth() | January | false |
| newYear().secondMonth() | February | false |
| newYear().unknownMonth() | error | true |
| year months\[3\] | March | true |
| new year() months \[2\] | February | true |
| year of (2006) is leap year() | false | true |
| year of (2004) is leap year() | true | true |
